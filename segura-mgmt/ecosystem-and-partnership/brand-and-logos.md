Welcome to the SeguraSafeSwap brand center, where you can find all the resources you need to understand our branding guidelines, utilize our logos, and represent our brand correctly in your communications and creative projects.

### Our Brand Identity

At SeguraSafeSwap, we are committed to building a brand that resonates with trust, innovation, and the pioneering spirit of the decentralized finance movement. Our brand identity is more than just our logo; it encompasses our values, our voice, and how we present ourselves to the world.

#### Core Values

* **Community**: Building a strong, informed, and engaged network of users and supporters.
* **Transparency**: Open and honest communication, fostering trust and reliability.

### Logo Usage

Our logos are a visual representation of everything SeguraSafeSwap stands for. They are an essential part of our brand and should be used thoughtfully and consistently.

#### Primary Logo

The primary SeguraSafeSwap logo should be used in most instances. It includes both the icon and the brand name.

#### Icon Only

The icon can be used on its own in contexts where the SeguraSafeSwap brand has already been established.

#### Logo Clear Space

Always maintain clear space around the logo. This should be at least the size of the 'S' in SeguraSafeSwap on all sides of the logo.

#### Color Palette

Our primary colors are a rich purple and white, representing the blend of sophistication (purple) and simplicity (white).

Primary Purple: `#6A1B9A` Secondary White: `#FFFFFF`

#### Incorrect Usage

* Do not alter the logo's colors or dimensions.
* Avoid using the logo in a way that suggests SeguraSafeSwap endorsement where it does not exist.
* Do not use the logo in a way that might suggest co-branding without explicit permission.
