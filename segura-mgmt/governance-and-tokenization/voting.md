## Governance and Voting: Your Voice in SeguraSafeSwap

At SeguraSafeSwap, we believe in the power of community-driven decision-making. Our platform is not just a service; it's a collaborative ecosystem where every user has a say. Governance and voting are at the heart of our commitment to decentralized operations and transparency.

* **Transparent Outcomes**: All votes are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring that the process is open and results are verifiable.

### How Voting Works
